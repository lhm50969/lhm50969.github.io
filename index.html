<th><p>Fresh water fishing has been a hobby of mine for about all of my life.
Every since I can remember I have been fishing around lakes in my hometown and across the state of Georgia.
I will give some insight on my experiences and some tips that may help lead to a more enjoyable trip.

<th><p> When fishing it is always important to know the your surroundings and the weather. That is what helps you figure out what the fish will be more likely to bite at so you will catch more fish. One of the first things to take into account is the watercolor and how to sky looks. If the water is clear you want to use more natural colors and try to mimic this fishesâ€™ surroundings. When the water is murky, using brighter colors will help the fish see your bait and will make them more likely to strike at it. </p></th>

<th><p><div style="text-align:center">One of final things to know about fresh water fishing is what bait to use based off the temperature of the water. When the water is colder, fish move slower so you would move your bait slower. In warmer weather, it is better to move your bait faster and even try to keep it higher up in the water. If you follow these simple tips, you are more likely to catch more fish and have a good time doing it</p></th>
